and his very cries and groans on making this
frightful discovery were turned into a snake's
hisses. What was he to do? He could not
go back to earth like this; for snakes are
hated there, and he was sure to be killed by
the first man who came across him. He could
think of no plan. But, without particularly
meaning to do so, he crept and glided along
to the mouth of the cavern by which he had
come into fairy-land; and there, tired out and
broken-hearted, he fell asleep at the foot of a
tall pine-tree.
   To him then in a dream appeared the spirit
of the pine-tree, and said: "I am a fairy.
I am       sorry to see you in this sad
plight.        Why did you eat the
fruits of    fairy-land?         They
are beautiful indeed to look at,  but
poisonous to human beings. It is because

you ate those grapes and mulberries, that you
have been turned into a serpent. If you wish
to become a man again, the
only thing for you to do
is to climb to the top
of this pine-tree, and
fling yourself down.
By doing that, you may
become a man again."
   On awaking from this
dream, the young hunter
(or rather serpent, as he
still saw himself to be)
was filled half with hope, half
with fear. But after thinking
for a little while, he made
up his mind to do
as the fairy
had told him.
