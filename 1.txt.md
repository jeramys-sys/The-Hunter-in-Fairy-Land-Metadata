         ONCE upon a time there was a
         handsome and brave young
T        man, who was very fond of hunt-
H        ing. So one fine winter's day,
E        when the snow was on the
H        ground, he went off to the moun-
U        tains with his bow and arrows,
N        to see if he could not shoot
T        a bear. After looking about for
E        some time, he found the track
R        of one; and, follow-
I        ing this track
N        up a narrow
F        valley, he
A        at last came
I        in sight of
RY-LAND  the bear itself.
