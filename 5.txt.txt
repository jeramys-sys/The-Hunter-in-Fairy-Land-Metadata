                    She was so beautiful, and
                      seemed so kind, that he
                                    could not
                                         help
loving her. 
After all, if the worst
came to the worst, he could but
be killed by the fall ; and to be killed would
bo better than to live on in the shape of a
serpent, whom every one would hate as a
poisonous reptile. So he glided up the pine-
tree, reached its very topmost branch, and,
screwing his courage together, threw himself
down headlong. Crash he went through the
air, felt a tremendous bump,
and then
fainted away.

On coming to his senses, he found himself
standing at the foot of the tree. Close to him
was the body of an immense serpent ripped
open; so that he had evidently been inside the
serpent, and had crept out without knowing
it. Of course his first thought was, Home!
But before starting, he bowed and thanked
the fairy of the pine-tree for the kind advice
which had helped to set him free. Then he
ran off, as fast as he could, through the long,
tunnel-shaped cavern, by which he had come
into fairy-land the day before. After walking
for some hours, he got to the other end, where
the cavern opened out on the top of the
mountain, at the spot where the bear
had disappeared.
