crags and roots of trees; and still the
bear kept so far ahead, that there was no
use in trying to shoot at it. At last, a

suddenly disappeared. Coming to
the place, the young hunter
saw that it
was the mouth of an immense cavern,
dark and high, and with just
a glimmer of
light
at the
other end. Although
he could no longer see the bear, he
made sure that it had
escaped through
this cavern.
