For the metadata I chose to record, I imagined that if someone happened upon each page separately, without the rest of the book to give context, what information they would need to understand what they were seeing. Much of the metadata I included can also been seen on the catalog and Colenda entries for the book overall, as they can also be used to describe each page individually. I also chose to add what section of the book each file contains, as I felt it could give a bit more context to understanding what someone would see in each picture (Is it the beginning or the end of the story? Is this the binding of the book?), as well as the IDs to each individual picture and its profile.
