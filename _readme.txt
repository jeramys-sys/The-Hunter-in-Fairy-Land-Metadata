For the metadata I chose to record, I imagined that if someone happened upon each page separately, without the rest of the book to give context, what information they would need to understand what they were seeing. Much of the metadata I included can also been seen on the catalog and Colenda entries for the book overall, as they can also be used to describe each page individually. I also chose to add what section of the book each file contains, as I felt it could give a bit more context to understanding what someone would see in each picture (Is it the beginning or the end of the story? Is this the binding of the book?), as well as the IDs to each individual picture and its profile.

Oct 20 Log:
The OCR was accurate for the pages of text that had less images on them, but tended to get a bit confused when images were present. Other small things I noticed was that it often turned 'e's into 'o's, and 's's into a series of ';' instead. Other than that, there weren't too many errors, and correcting the spelling was overall easy. However, I had to make a few choices for how I wanted to present the text given the media I was dealing with. The text in the fairytale was often intertwined with drawings inside the lines themselves, so I wasn't sure how to reflect that an image was there in the original text in my document. I ultimately decided to show their presence by including spaces where the images originally were. Another issue I quickly encountered was the fact that each page in the story wasn't separated, as the left and right side of any given page was counted as one single page in Colenda. I decided to keep pages that were paired together in the same text file, and just show that they were separate pages by including a space between their paragraphs.
